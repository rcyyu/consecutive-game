Setup:
# of players 2-12
If more than three are playing, they should be evenly divided into 2 or 3 teams, therefore:
2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 possible players a game.

Players will alternate between teams with each player of a team. 
ie. R1, B1, G1, R2, B2, G2, R1, B1, G1, R2... for 3 teams
    or R1, B1, R2, B2, R1, B1... for two teams

If the player who played first wins and the seconds player wins in the next turn it's a tie
(Probably do this with rounds)

There is a draw deck, a discard pile, and marker chips. Jokers are discarded.

Each player gets holds a number of cards depending on the number of players.
2 players: 7 cards
3 players: 6 cards
4 players: 6 cards
6 players: 5 cards
8 players: 4 cards
9 players: 4 cards
10 players: 3 cards
12 players: 3 cards

During a player's turn:
Player chooses a card from their hand, and places a chip on one of the corresponding spaces
of the game board. ie. Drawing an Ace of Diamonds places a chip on one of two Ace of Diamonds
on the board.
Chips can be placed on the appropriate card pace as long as it is not occupied.
If both spaces of a card the player has are occupied, then the card is dead and the player
draws a new card.
Jacks are wild.
- Two-Eyed Jacks can represent any card and may be used to place a chip on any
  space on the board
- One-Eyed Jacks can remove an opponent's advantage by removing a chip from any occupied
  space on the board with the exception of already completed sequences
After the card is drawn, it goes into the discard pile.
The player draws a replacement card from the draw deck.
